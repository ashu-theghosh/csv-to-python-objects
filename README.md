CSV to Python Objects
This project demonstrates how to read structured student data from a CSV file and convert each row into a Python object using a custom class. It combines data handling with Pandas and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts to simulate a simple data pipeline.

🧩 Project Overview
📥 Load data from a CSV using pandas
🧱 Parse and restructure data using dictionaries and nested fields
🧑‍🎓 Wrap each row into a class instance (Convert)
📤 Display structured information with custom methods

Technologies Used
Python
Pandas

Key Concepts Demonstrated
Reading structured CSV data using pandas
Creating Python class instances from tabular data
Storing and displaying nested information (like address)
Applying real-world OOP techniques in data transformation
